class RootTracker:
    '''
    Class to track the roots that are found found using the subdivision solver.

    Attributes
    ----------
    roots: numpy array
        The roots of the system being solved
    possible_duplicates : list
        Roots that were outside their search interval so might be duplicates
    potential_roots : numpy array
        Places that may or may not have a root that we found.
    intervals : list
        The intervals that the roots were found in.
    polish_intervals : list
        The intervals to run polishing on.
    methods : list
        The methods used to find the roots.

    Methods
    -------
    __init__
        Initializes everything.
    add_roots
        Adds roots the were found to the list, along with their information.
    add_potential_roots
        Adds roots that were found by the solver but are questionable. We will
        want to double check that these roots aren't duplicated elsewhere or that
        they give a fairly good answer.
    get_polish_intervals
        Gets the intervals to run the next round of polishing on.
